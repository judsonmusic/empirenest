        <h3>We are the owners and sole manufacturers of the Empire Nest processing center in East Java Indonesia.</h3>

        <p>We offer the finest quality of edible bird nests in several grades, shapes, sizes & color. Our state of the art processing
          lines guarantees perfect quality and the best possible prices.</p>

        <p>Our bird nests are 100% pure swallow nest. We use a traditional hand cleaning technique in processing our bird nests.
          Although this technique is time consuming and causes a significant weight loss of the raw bird nests during the
          cleaning process, it guarantees that no other chemicals or additives are added during the process.</p>

        <p>Please note that actual shape and color may vary from the picture.</p>

        <p>Our farming and cleaning process is 100% manual, without using any artificial coloring and chemical ingredients.</p>

        <p>Indonesia’s history in the bird's nest trade goes as far back as the 17th century. Until today, Indonesia is the
          biggest producer of edible bird's nest, supplying 80% of the world's bird's nest consumption, followed by Thailand
          10% and Malaysia 7%.</p>
